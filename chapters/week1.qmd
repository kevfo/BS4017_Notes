# Introduction to Linux and the Command Line (untested)

This week's lecture aims to cover the following topics:

1.  Basics of using Linux and Unix systems.
1.  Understand Unix design principles and why they are good for bioinformatics and software development (generally speaking).

Like the title of chapter implies, the information presented in this chapter will not be tested.

## A Brief Introduction to Computers

### Turing's Machine

```

A **universal machine** is a machine that can solve any sequence of problems that can be solved using a computer. An machine is called **Turing complete** if it can act like a **Turing machine**: a machine that is capable of following certain rules to solve problems in a stepwise fashion. Many of today's programming languages are Turing-complete.

### Machine Language

**Machine language** is the only thing that computers understand.  

The **c**entral **p**rocessing **u**nit (i.e., **CPU**) is the so-called "brain" of the computer and uses **bits** to work.  When one talks about a "64-bit: CPU, it means the groups of bits are 64 in length. 

Computers understand instructions in a language made of bits, but it's really tough for people to read and figure out what's going on. So, to make it easier, an **o**perating **s**ystem (i.e., **OS**) is necessary.  This is like a middleman that helps us talk to the computer in a way we can understand better.

## Unix OS

The **Uniplexed nformation and Computer Service** (i.e., **Unix** for short) OS - often pronounced as "eunuchs" was created at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s to help make software. 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Photograph of Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../imgs/week1/ken.png")
```

In 1969, it started as a bunch of instructions written in a language computers understand, and it was made by Ken Thompson. Then, between 1972 and 1974, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie made a new version using a language called "C".  Back then, anyone could look at and use the code for free. 

But in the early 1980s, the company AT&T decided to keep the code secret and started selling licenses for using Unix. It even led to different versions of Unix being made by different companies. 

Interestingly, Mac OS X, the operating system used in Mac computers, is a type of Unix too!

### Unix Philosophy

The design idea behind Unix programs can be summarized into three bullet points:

1.  Write programs that are really good at doing one thing.
1.  Write programs that can team up and help one another out.
1.  Write programs that are good at dealing with text, because text is one way that everyone can talk to one another.

The **command line** is also the key to using a Linux system.

There are also nine "paramount precepts" as Mike Gancarz summarizes:

1. Remember, small things are nice.
1. Each program should be awesome at doing just one thing.
1. Build a simple version first to test.
1. It's better if your stuff works on lots of different computers.
1. Keep your information in plain text files.
1. Use existing software to help you do more.
1. Use special scripts to make things even better and work on different computers.
1. Don't trap people in your program; let them do what they want.
1. Make each program a tool to help with tasks.

## Linux OS

professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones."

Linux is like a free operating system that works with Unix (i.e., older systems).  When Unix started costing money in the 1980s, people wanted a free option.  Linux is like the core part of a computer system (i.e., the **kernel**), connecting the software to the hardware and different programs to each other. To make it a complete system, it's joined with other software, and this whole package is called a **distribution**.

### Why Use Linux?

It's trustworthy and stays steady with fewer problems. There's hardly any viruses to worry about. It's quick because it's built really well. Plus, Linux is free - the software is **open**, which means it works well with other things and gets better quickly. 

If you want to make your own programs, it's easy with Linux because there are free tools and helpful information. One can also change the Linux OS code if they want to.

#### Why Use Linux for Bioinformatics Data Analysis?

Linux has lots of little tools made by many people that can each do a small part of the work. One can mix these tools together to create pipelines that do big tasks. 

It's also a fantastic platform for open-source software, which means one can use many programming languages and libraries without paying. 

But, keep in mind that using Linux might not be as easy as some other options. one'll have to type commands on a special line, and it only does exactly what one tells it to, not what you might want it to do automatically.

## Bash and the Command Line

### What is Bash?

When one uses a computer with Unix, they can talk to it through something called a **terminal emulator**. This is a "window" to type things. 

The terminal helps one use a special interface called a **shell**, which is like a way to talk to the computer by typing commands. There are different types of shells, but "**bash**" is the most common. It's been around since 1989 and is used in systems like Linux and Apple's OS X.

### The Command Line

The **command line** is a place where one types in what they want the computer to do. It's not as easy as clicking on icons like in a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (i.e., **GUI**), but it has its benefits. 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Command Line Appearance After Logging into Singapore's National Supercomputing Center", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../imgs/week1/example.png")
```

It's a bit harder for beginners because they need to learn the right words (commands), but it's faster and lets them do more. One can write down everything they do in a text file, which can be helpful. It's also great for working with text and making the computer do things over and over automatically.

#### Example: Connecting to a Remote Server Using an Encrypted SSH Protocol

**S**ecure **sh**ell (i.e., **SSH**) and **s**ecure **c**o**p**y (i.e., **SCP**) are like special ways to talk to a computer securely. They were made by someone named Tatu YlÃ¶nen in 1995. 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Diagrammatic Explanation of How SSH Works", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../imgs/week1/ssh.png")
```

Imagine one is sending secret messages over an unsecure network. SSH makes a safe pathway using a special key that has a lot of numbers. This key comes in two parts: the **public key**, which can be shared, and the **private key**, which keeps things secret.

### Basic Bash Operations

#### Fundamental Operations

Some basic commands include:

1.  `ls` - this lists all files and folders in the current working directory.
1.  `cd` - this changes the working directory.
1.  `cp` - this makes a copy of a file.

Commands also have something called **flags** that modify the output.  For instance, `ls -la` lists all files (including the hidden ones) in the current working directory in long form.

Commands also take in **arguments** to complete the command - for instance, `cp file1 ../folder1`.

The `man` command displays helpful information about a command - for instance, `man ls` will list information about the `ls` command.

#### Bash Variables

In bash, one can use variables like containers for information. 

For example, one can say `A=1` to put the number `1` in a variable called `A`. When one wants to use that number, they can add a "\$" before the variable's name, like "\$A". 

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Examples of Assigning and Displaying the Values of Bash Variables", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../imgs/week1/variables.png")
```

To show the value of a variable on the screen, they can use `echo` and write `echo $A`. Some variables are made by the computer, like `PATH`, which tells the computer where to look for programs. One can also add their own places to look by changing PATH.

#### Redirects

When you one runs a regular Unix command, it shows words on the screen. However, one can make those words go somewhere else too. 

For example, if they want to list files and save the list in a file, they can write `ls > listfile.txt`. If they want to add more files to that list, they can write `ls >> listfile.txt`. 

They can also make the words go to another command by using a **pipe**, like `ls | grep listfile`. 

You can do this as many times as you need.

### Linux File System

In Unix, there aren't "hard drives" like we usually think of them. Instead, there are directories. Think of these as special folders. '

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Example of a Linux File System", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../imgs/week1/fs.png")
```

When one connects to a hard drive, it's divided into pieces, and each piece is attached to a directory. So, the directory shows what's in that piece of the hard drive. 

When one uses the "mount" command, it links a special part of the hard drive or even something from another computer to a directory. This way, the directory shows the stuff from that hard drive or computer.

### Permission Management in Linux

In Unix, there are three groups for who can do what with files. The first is the **user** who owns the file - they can keep things private. 

Then there's a bigger group of users who can share files. Finally, there's **others**, which means everyone else. There are three types of things you can do with files: 

1.  read (r)
1.  write (w)
1.  execute (x)

These permissions are like rules for each group saying what they can and can't do with the files.

### Bash as a Turing-Complete Language

The bash shell isn't just about doing things; it's like a language for telling the computer what to do. The programs you make using the Bash language are called shell scripts. These scripts are like lists of instructions that the computer understands. 

They're translated and done by the computer right away, which makes Bash an "interpreted" language. Shell scripts are really good for quickly working with text and doing powerful things. For example, at NSCC, they have a system where you put your special list (script) in a line and the computer runs it when it's ready.

### Useful Pointers When Using Linux

Prof. Jarkko also lists some tips when using Linux to work on tasks: 

1.  You can't easily get back deleted files.
1.  Small and capital letters matter in commands and file names.
1.  Some characters like #;& " / ' : < > | * ? $ ( ) \{ \} [ ] and space do special things.
1.  It's safest to use only letters, numbers, _ (underscore), and . (dot) in file names.
1.  If you use those special characters, put quotes around the name.
1.  File names can be anything, like a `mytext.txt` file might not be text, but it's good to follow conventions!

## How Does Programming Work?

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Relationships Between Levels of Programming Languages", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../imgs/week1/machineLanguage.png")
```

Programming languages, like C/C++ and Visual Basic, or Python, R, and Matlab, use special tools to change the commands one writes into instructions the computer understands. These tools are like translators. Some languages use a **compiler**, which does the translation all at once, while others use an **interpreter**, which does it step by step.

### Compilers vs. Interpreters 

There are two main ways to change one's programming commands into computer language:

1.  **Compiler:** 

    It takes your list of commands (code) and changes it all into computer language at once. This gives one a file that they can run as a program. One can use it from the command line or through a nice interface.
    
1.  **Interpreter:** 

    It changes your commands into computer language one by one as they use them. They can give commands directly or run a list of them from a file called a **script**. This is like a set of instructions in a text file.
    
### Low versus High Level Languages

**Low-level programming languages** are like really simple tools for computers. They only know how to do basic things, and they're kind of like talking to the computer in its own language. They can work directly with memory and other computer parts. This makes them run really fast, but when one wants to do complex things, they have to write a lot of instructions, and it can be hard to find mistakes in their code.

**High-level programming languages** are like using simpler words for computers. They're farther away from the computer's language, so they're easier for people to understand. They work kind of like how humans talk, and they're good for organizing things like objects. When one uses them, they can write less code because they can do complicated stuff in a simpler way. That's why many people like using them for most things they create on computers.
